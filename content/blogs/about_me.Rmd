title: A little about me

My name is Kelly Zhang. I live in Shenzhen, China, where this picture can portray its glamour.

I'm currently studying Masters of Financial Analysis at London Business School.

I realized the impact capital markets have on economic activities and on individual’s aspirations. Thus, I hope to become a investment banker in China and use my skills to facilitate the growth of more companies through capital market.

My undergraduate studies in economics and psychology have broadened my conception of the
world. From economics, I learned to apply concepts such as game theory into acquisition where rational actors always act in their own best interest, even if it results in a sub optimal outcome. The continuous development of economy is also guided by human psychological behaviors, especially under the background of changing international trade environments. Combining my knowledge in both areas, I gradually learned to think the financial events in the framework of economic policies at the macro level, as well as the social behaviors of individual market players at the micro level.

My internship experience has further bridged the gap between academia and practice. As an
investment banking intern at CICC, where I contributed to the aspects of 3 IPO transactions in different sectors, I raised concerns on investment decisions and independently researched and drafted supporting analysis on geo political risks to better assist my teamteam’s valuation reports and subsequent effective communication with the clients, which helped me dev elop stronger research ability and critical thinking skills.

For my graduate study, I am seeking to develop an in depth understanding of a changing economy
to further my career aspiration in the investment banking industry.
